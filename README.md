# Ansible configuration for adp devs

**NOTE:** Before you start the script make sure the proxy settings are commented out inside your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`.

`./ansible-install`

And that's it.

## Next steps

* Define a `git` user under `.gitconfig`
* `tmux` -> `<Ctrl-b>I`
* Add your id in: `git/.gitconfig`.
* `cd ~/dotfiles` -> `nvim` -> `:PackerSync` (launch several times until all plugins install successfully)
